            <h1>Achievement Gap</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>While many of MCPS’s students are achieving at the highest levels in our nation, other students are being left behind - for instance, I had terrible grades this school year. In order to address this gap, I propose being elected into SMOB, which greatly improves college and career prospects for those selected students. While the exact correlation between SMOB election or <a href="http://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Governance/Citizen-Participation-and-Engagement/Youth-Participation-in-Local-Government.aspx">similar elected political positions</a> and college admissions has not been extensively studied, college admissions look for applicants who show initiative, have a higher chance of raising or maintaining the institution’s credibility, and overall stand out from their peers. Those who have held local government positions are potentially very attractive for colleges and for employers in the relevant industries, making a SMOB election a great achievement to fill in my achievement gap.             </p>

            <h1>COVID-19</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>While in-person education is important, especially for those who are most at risk of being left behind, so is the safety and health of our communities, especially when the most vulnerable families in education are also the ones who are hit the hardest by COVID in other aspects. But, without access to improved negotiating powers as outlined in other sections, it is likely that the state and national government will force a return to physical school by next fall. In the meantime, I would like to take a filthy, weak, centrist approach of collaborating with the state and national government to ensure the safe return of our staff and students next fall, by supporting the novel idea of distributing vaccines and PPE, and creating an environment conducive to social distancing and safe practices. Regarding the current semester, I will rely on vague, broad, and agreeable statements in order to increase electability as much as possible, given a lack of a solid plan nor the ability to act on them until the next school year.</p>

            <h1>Democratizing SMOB</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Countywide student government organizations currently have the issue of failing to truly represent the student body of Montgomery County. Virtually all recent SMOB candidates who have made it to the general elections are from upper-income schools, and almost all general elections have had a candidate from Richard Montgomery High School. To put this into context, it would be as if almost every recent presidential election had one of the two main party candidates be from Texas. The Montgomery County Regional SGA, or MCR-SGA on the other hand is not a democratic organization, using a theoretically merit-based selection process and lobbying to push its own agenda. </p>
            <p>The main causes behind the state of affairs are the inherent problems with limiting student representation to one person within the County government and the rather opaque process that is the primary elections, which creates a gap between the general student body and the few who are heavily involved in activism. I imagine for many of those who aren’t that involved in politics and activism, the SMOB candidates can seem like two people who appeared out of nowhere - I certainly had that feeling in the past. </p>
            <p>In order to bring the student body and their representation closer, I propose the replacement of the lone SMOB position with a student parliament, similar to the MCR but endowed with formal powers by the Montgomery County government. The Student Parliament would be made of elected high schoolers representing each school cluster, perhaps 2 representatives per cluster. Within the Parliament, members would elect a head representative to represent the parliament and the students at the Board of Education, but the regular members of the parliament would still be the ones discussing the stance on the issues, and the head would merely act strictly as a representative of the body. By distributing representation and putting them much closer to the students , student representatives will be much more engaged with the student body and school SGAs, increasing transparency and decreasing apathy. </p>

            <h1>Discrimination</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>While certain circles have been advocating for more awareness of the plight of Gamers, Gamers still remain the most oppressed minority so far. In a 2021 survey of 8 people who completed said survey, 50% of participants rated the statement “gamers are oppressed” as true, and 88% at least somewhat agreed with the statement “society discourages people from insulting women, ethnic minorities, and gender/sexual/romantic minorities.” In other words, one of the key pillars of Gamer culture is under attack by society!  This is a clear indication of Gamer oppression.</p>
            <p>While Gamer culture may be irreversibly harmed by the culture war, Gamer oppression is a prongfaceted issue, and other aspects of the matter should not be ignored. For instance, the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of technology access, especially to lower-income Gamers. At the same time, the global semiconductor shortage has made accessing high performance devices harder for all Gamers. Seeing as access to high performance computers have real cultural and educational value as it enables students to culturally enrich themselves with hidden gems such as The Witcher 3 and opens up new opportunities for both independent and guided STEAM education.</p>
            <p>In fighting Gamer oppression, and promoting STEAM education and technological literacy, I propose funding the creation of technological playgrounds within schools, where students can be exposed to high performance computing and various novel computing technologies such as linux virtualization that they may not have access to at home, in a safe, supervised environment. This would especially be helpful for disadvantaged students who may not even have a stable environment at home conducive to learning. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be a Gamer at home, and we should be leveling the playing field to equitably provide compute access.</p>

            <h1>Green Representation</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Fairly recent Maryland state policies such as governor Hogan’s executive order extending summer break statewide to Labor Day, at the potential expense of breaks during the school year, which is vital to student and staff mental health. Additionally and more recently, Hogan attempted to order all schools to reopen by March 1st, in line with President Biden’s agenda. And perhaps these conflicts could be worse with less moderate politicians in office - such as Donald Trump. When the student body comes into disagreement with state and national legislation, it is important that we hold our ground and stand up for what is right.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the looming issue of climate change pressures MCPS to go green, with proposals such as rooftop solar on schools and electrification of school buses. However, conventional renewable energy sources require extensive and costly grid energy storage, with associated costs skyrocketing as more and more of the grid is converted to renewables. Meanwhile, the latest generation of nuclear power is very promising, with highly advanced safety features preventing negligence-caused incidents. Specifically, Small Modular Reactors - SMRs - promise mass-produced, affordable and easy to manage nuclear power, ideal for powering education.</p>
            <p>In order to solve both issues (and then some), MCPS should acquire SMRs as soon as possible, and push the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revise regulations to bring it in line with the potential of the latest in reactor technology and our nation’s environmental, energy, and security needs. SMRs could become a vital part of hands-on education for both college and career, giving students opportunities to pursue STEM and help close the achievement gap, especially when related fields are expected to grow in demand over the coming decades. The added funding boost from selling power back to the grid is a nice added advantage too. Most importantly, SMRs could pave the way for more advanced reactors and student acquisition of nuclear physics packages, which will greatly enhance the bargaining power of the Montgomery County student body within all levels of governance.</p>

            <p>Hi, I'm Sam N, and I'm a junior at Wootton High School, or well, its complicated. I'm mainly interested in computers and engineering, well, that also is complicated. Yes, I have a lot going on in my life. I also do have an eye for international relations and security policies, where technology and politics meet. No, I am not an actual Montgomery County SMOB candidate, nor am I eligiable to be one. But I did want to bring some insights and attention to the SMOB position and what it really is. </p>
